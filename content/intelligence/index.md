The [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) Intelligence and Analytics team researches emerging threats and risks, analyzes
activity groups, adversaries, attack patterns, and campaigns as a way to understand and report on, the ever-evolving
threat landscape.

**Activity Group**
An activity group is a set of events and activity associated by similarities in their features and weighted by confidence
scoring. Simply put, it is a clustering of intrusions with weighting on the Adversary, Infrastructure, Tradecraft
(Capability/TTP) and/or Victim of the intrusions that meets some analytical requirement.

**Adversary**
Adversary/Threat is a representation of the human behind the keyboard. It can be the individual, team, or a government.
Defining what the specific of a threat means requires different models. The important understanding of a threat is that
it is the entity involved in the execution of an intrusion. We use the term threat interchangeable with adversary. Note
that a threat is not a vulnerability, nor is it a tool (such as a piece of malicious code).

**Attack Pattern**
Attack Patterns are a type of TTP that describe ways that adversaries attempt to compromise targets. Attack Patterns are
used to help categorize attacks, generalize specific attacks to the patterns that they follow, and provide detailed
information about how attacks are performed. An example of an attack pattern is "spear phishing": a common type of attack
where an attacker sends a carefully crafted e-mail message to a party with the intent of getting them to click a link or
open an attachment to deliver malware. Attack Patterns can also be more specific; spear phishing as practiced by a
particular threat actor (e.g., they might generally say that the target won a contest) can also be an Attack Pattern.

**Campaign**
A campaign or operation is the adversary's mission focus, such as a malicious group of adversaries targeting financial networks.

The research published by this team focuses on the strategic, operational, and tactical observations from intrusions and
campaigns with the goal of releasing targeted research to aid threat hunters, analysts, and defenders in improving the
protective posture of their environments.
