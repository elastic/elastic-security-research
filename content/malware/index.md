The [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) Security Research team collects and analyzes malware samples from campaigns,
intrusions, and the infosec community-at-large.

While all malware isn't novel or interesting; samples that employ unique features and capabilities warrant an analysis
 report that will better the community in knowledge of their functionality. Additionally, malware analysis reports will
  provide logic and hunting queries that can identify clever malware in your environment.
