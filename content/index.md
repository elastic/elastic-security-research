title: Elastic Security Research
---

The [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) Security Research team pairs research on emerging threats with analysis of strategic, operational, and tactical adversary objectives.

The team produces public-facing content, in the way of summary blogs, detailed releases, and artifacts; articulating both adversary campaign activities and threat detection steps that can be leveraged to frustrate adversary goals.

The team publishes a variety of content: 

* Analysis of malware signatures, behavior protections, and detection rules assessed against real-world malware and adversary techniques;
* Whitepapers focused on vulnerabilities, exploits, and other research relevant to the security community at-large; and
* Tools created to aid in the collection and analysis of threat data

Research priorities are chosen through open-source research vehicles, inputs from high-confidence third parties, and data collected from Elastic's evolving telemetry.
