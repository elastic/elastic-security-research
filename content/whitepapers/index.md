Most of the research and analysis that the [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) Security Research team performs is focused
squarely around campaigns, activity groups, intrusion sets, intrusions, and malware.

While that research is tremendously important, there is a great amount of content that is created and released by the
team that falls to the left or right of that charge.

We feel that if an analyst, researcher, engineer, or janitor took the time to write a cogent and topical research paper
for the community, then the community has a right to consume and use it however they can.

This page is focused on that: whitepapers that contain great infosec knowledge, but is not directly within the campaigns,
activity groups, intrusion sets, intrusions, and malware buckets.
